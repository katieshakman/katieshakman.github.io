          Consulted for Therachat, a company that helps therapists and patients connect in between talk therapy sessions.  I built TheraPulse, a tool for predicting patientsâ€™ symptom severity, using NLP, SVM, Random Forest, and grid search hyperparameter optimization.  The final product was a Dash web app which would predict a user's distress level for the following week.
